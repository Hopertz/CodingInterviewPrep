"""
     Line Through Points o â˜†
   You're given an array of points plotted on a 2D graph (the xy-plane). Write a function that returns the
   maximum number of points that a single line (or potentially multiple lines) on the graph passes through.
   The input array will contain points represented by an array of two integers [x, y] . The input array will
   never contain duplicate points and will always contain at least one point.
      Sample Input
        points = [
           [1, 1],
           [2, 2],
           (3, 3),
           [0, 4],
           [-2, 6],
           [4, 0],
           [2, 1],
        ]
      Sample Output
      4 // A line passes through points: [-2, -6], [0, 4], [2, 2], [4, 0].
