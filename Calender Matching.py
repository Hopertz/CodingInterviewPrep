"""
   Calendar Matching â™¡
    Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a co-worker. You have access to your calendar
    and your co-worker's calendar (both of which contain
    your respective meetings for the day, in the form of [startTime, endTime] ), as well as both of your daily bounds
    (i.e., the earliest and latest times at which you're
    available for meetings every day, in the form of [earliestTime, latestTime] ).
    Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your co-worker's calendar, your co-worker's daily
    bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to
    schedule, and that returns a list of all the time blocks (in the form of [startTime, endTime] ) during which you
    could schedule the meeting ordered from earliest time block to latest.

    Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time. For example: 8:30 , 9:01 , and 23:56 .
    Also note that the given calendar times will be sorted by start time in ascending order, as you would expect them
    to appear in a calendar application like Google Calendar.

     Sample Input
        calendar1 = [['9:00', '10:30'], ['12:00', '13:00'], ['16:00', '18:00']]
        dailyBounds1 = ['9:00', '20:00']
        calendar2 = [['10:00', '11:30'], ['12:30', '14:30'], ['14:30', '15:00'], ['16:00', '17:00']]
        dailyBounds2 = ['10:00', '18:30']
        meetingDuration = 30

     Sample Output
        [['11:30', '12:00'], ['15:00', '16:00'], ['18:00', '18:30']]
