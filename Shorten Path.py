"""
    Shorten Path
   Write a function that takes in a non-empty string representing a valid Unix-shell path and returns a shortened version of that path.
   A path is a notation that represents the location of a file or directory in a file system.
   A path can be an absolute path, meaning that it starts at the root directory in a file system, or a relative path, meaning that it starts at the
   current directory in a file system.
   In a Unix-like operating system, a path is bound by the following rules:
   
   • The root directory is represented by a / . This means that if a path starts with / it's an absolute path; if it doesn't, it's a relative
   path.

   • The symbol, otherwise represents the directory separator. This means that the path /foo/bar is the location of the directory
   bar inside the directory foo , which is itself located inside the root directory.

   • The symbol .. represents the parent directory. This means that accessing files or directories in /foo/bar/.. is equivalent to
   accessing files or directories in /foo.

   • The symbol . represents the current directory. This means that accessing files or directories in /foo/bar/. is equivalent to
   accessing files or directories in /foo/bar.

   • The symbols / and . can be repeated sequentially without consequence; the symbol .. cannot, however, because repeating
   it sequentially means going further up in parent directories. For example. /foo/bar/baz/././. and /foo/bar/baz are
   equivalent paths, but /foo/bar/baz/../../../ and /foo/bar/baz definitely aren't. The only exception is with the root
   directory: /../../.. and / are equivalent, because the root directory has no parent directory, which means that repeatedly
   accessing parent directories does nothing.
   Note that the shortened version of the path must be equivalent to the original path. In other words, it must point to the same file or
   directory as the original path.

   Sample Input
      path = "/foo/../test/../test/../foo//bar/./baz"
   Sample Output
       "/foo/bar/baz" // This path is equivalent to the input path.
