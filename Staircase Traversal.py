"""
  Staircase Traversal

  You're given two positive integers representing the height of a staircase and the maximum
  number of steps that you can advance up the staircase at a time.Write a function that
  returns the number of ways in which you can climb the staircase.

  or example,if you were given a staircase of height = 3 and maxSteps = 2 you could climb the
  staircase in 3 ways.You could take 1 step, 1step, then 1 step, you could also take 1 step, then
  2 steps, and you could take 2 steps,then 1 step.

  Note that maxSteps <= height will always be true.

  Sample Input
    height = 4
    maxSteps = 2

  Sample Output
    5
    // You can climb the staircase in the following ways:
    // 1, 1, 1, 1
    // 1, 1, 2
    // 1, 2, 1
    // 2, 1, 1
    // 2, 2
