"""
  Invert Binary Tree

  Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it.In other words,the function
  should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding right node.

  Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
  Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None/null.

  Sample Input
      tree  =   1
              /   \
             2      3
            / \    /  \
           4    5 6   7
         / \
        8   9

  Sample Output

      tree  =   1
              /   \
             3     2
            / \    /  \
           7   6  5   4
                     /  \
                    9    8
