"""
   Longest Peak

   Write a function that takes in array of integers and returns the length of the longest
   peak in the array.

   A peak is defined as adjacent integers in the array that are strictly increasing until
   they reach a tip (the highest value in the peak). at which point they become strictly
   decreasing.At least three integers are required to form a peak.

   For example,the integers 1, 4, 10, 2 form a peak, but the integers 4, 0, 10 don't and
   neither do the integers 1, 2, 2, 0. Similarly,the integers 1, 2, 3 don't form a peak
   because there aren't any strictly decreasing integers after the 3.

   Sample Input
     array = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3, 2, 3]

   Sample Output
     6 // 0, 10, 6, 5, -1, -3
