"""
   Array of Products

   Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an array of the
   same length, where each element in the output array is equal to the product of every
   other number in the input array.

   In other words,the value at output[i] is equal to the product of every number in the
   input array other than input[i].

   Note that you're expected to solve this problem without using division

   Sample Input
     array = [5, 1, 4, 2]

   Sample Output
     [8, 40, 10, 20]

     // 8 is equal to 1 x 4 x 2
     // 40 is equal to 5 x 4 x 2
     // 10 is equal to 5 x 1 x 2
     // 20 is equal to 5 x 1 x 4
