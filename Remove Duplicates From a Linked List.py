"""
   Remove Duplicates From a Linked List

   You're given the head of Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order with
   respect to their values. Write a function that returns a modified version of the
   Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values.The Linked List
   should be modified in place(i.e you shouldn't create a brand new list),and the
   modified LInked List should still have its nodes sorted with respect to their values.

   Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the
   next node in the list or to None / null if it's the tail of the list.

   Sample Input
      linkedList = 1 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 6  // the head node with value 1

   Sample Output
      1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 // the head node with value 1
