"""
   Non-Attacking Queens o â˜†
  Write a function that takes in a positive integer n and returns the number of non-attacking placements of n queens on
  an nxn chessboard.
  A non-attacking placement is one where no queen can attack another queen in a single turn. In other words, it's a
  placement where no queen can move to the
  same position as another queen in a single turn.
  In chess, queens can move any number of squares horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in a single turn.

  The chessboard above is an example of a non-attacking placement of 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard. For reference, there
  are only 2 non-attacking placements
  of 4 queens on a 4x4 chessboard.

   Sample Input
      n = 4

   Sample Output
    2
