"""
   Iterative In-order Traversal  â˜†
  Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree (where nodes have an additional pointer to their parent node) and traverses
  it iteratively using the in-order tree-traversal technique; the traversal should specifically not use recursion. As the
  tree is being traversed, a callback function passed in as anargument to the main function should be called on each node
  (i.e., callback(currentNode) ).
  Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a parent node, a left child node, and a right child node. Children nodes
  can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null .

   Sample Input
        tree  =   1
                /   \
               2      3
              /      /  \
             4      6   7
             \
             9
        callback = someCallback
   Sample Output
     // The input callback will have been called in the following order:
     callback(4)
     callback(9)
     callback(2)
     callback(1)
     callback(6)
     callback(3)
     callback(7)
