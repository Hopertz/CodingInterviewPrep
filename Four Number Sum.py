"""
  Four Number Sum
  Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing
  a target  sum.The function should find all quadruplets in the array that sum up to the target sum
  and return a two dimensional array of ll these quadruplets in no particular order.

  If no four numbers sum up to the target sum,the function should return an empty array.

  Sample Input
     array = [7, 6, 4, -1, 1, 2]
     targetSum = 16

  Sample Output
     [[7,6,4,-1], [7,6,1,2]] //the quadruplets could be ordered differently
