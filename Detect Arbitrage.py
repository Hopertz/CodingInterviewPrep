"""
        Detect Arbitrage â˜†
     You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of equal height and width that represents the exchange rates of arbitrary currencies. The
     length of the array is the number of currencies, and every currency can be converted to every other currency. Each currency is
     represented by a row in the array, where values in that row are the floating-point exchange rates between the row's currency and all
     other currencies, as in the example below.

             0:USD 1:CAD 2: GBP
       0:USD [ 1.0, 1.27, 0.718]
       1:CAD [ 0.74, 1.0, 0.56 ]
       2:GBP [ 1.39, 1.77, 1.0 ]

    In the matrix above, you can see that row represents USD, which means that row contains the exchange rates for 1 USD to all
    other currencies. Since row 1 represents CAD, index 1 in the USD row contains the exchange for 1 USD to CAD. The currency labels
    are listed above to help you visualize the problem, but they won't actually be included in any inputs and aren't relevant to solving this
    problem.
    Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether an arbitrage opportunity exists with the given exchange rates. An arbitrage
    occurs if you can start with C units of one currency and execute a series of exchanges that lead you to having more than C units of
    the same currency you started with.
    Note: currency exchange rates won't represent real-world exchange rates, and there might be multiple ways to generate an arbitrage.


       Sample Input
       exchangeRates [
          [ 1.0  , 0.8631, 0.5903],
          [1.1586, 1.0,  0.6849 ],
          [1.6939, 1.46,  1.0  ],
      ]

      Sample Output
        true
