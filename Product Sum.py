"""
   Product Sum

   Write a function that takes in a "special" array and return its product sum

   A "special" array is a none-empty array that contains either integers or other
   "special" arrays.The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements,where
   "special" arrays inside it are summed themselves and then multiplied by their level
   of depth.

   The depth of "special" array is how far nested it is.For instance,the depth of [] is 1;
   the depth of the inner array in [[]] is 2; the depth of the innermost array in [[[]]] is
   3.

   Therefore, the product sum of [x,y] is x + y; the product sum of [x, [y, z]]
   is x + 2 * (y+z); the product sum of [x, [y, [z]]] is x +2 * (y+ 3z).

   Sample Input

     array = [5, 2, [7,-1], 3, [6, [-13, 8], 4]]

   Sample Output
     12 // calculated as : 5 + 2 + 2 * (7 - 1) + 3 + 2 * (6 + 3 * (-13+8) + 4)

"""
# SOLUTION 1

# Running time O(n) | space 0(d) where n is total number of elements including
# sub-elements, and d is the greatest depth of special arrays in the array.
def productSum(array, depth=1):
    sums = 0
    for elem in array:
        if isinstance(elem, list):
            sums += productSum(elem, depth + 1)
        else:
            sums += elem
    return depth * sums
