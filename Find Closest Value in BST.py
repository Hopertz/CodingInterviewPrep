"""
   Find the closest Value in BST

   Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree(BST) and a target integer value
   and returns the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.

   You can assume that there will only be one closest value.

   Each BST node has an integer value, a left  child node, and a right child node.
   A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property:
   Its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value
   is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right and its children nodes
   are either valid BST nodes themselves or None / null.

   Sample Input
      tree  =  10
              /   \
             5     15
            / \    / \
           2   5  13  22
         /         \
        1          14

      target = 12

    Sample Output
     13
