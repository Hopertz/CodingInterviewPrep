"""
  Single Cycle Check

  You're given an array of integers where each integer represents a jump of its value in the array.
  For instance ,the integer 2 represents a jump of two indices forward in the array; the integer -3
  represents a jump of three indices backward in the array.

  If a jump spills past the array's bounds,it wraps over to the other side.For instance , a jump of
  -1 at index 0 brings us to the last index in the array.Similarly, a jump of 1 at the last index in
  the array brings us to index 0.

  Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether the jumps in the array form a single
  cycle.A single cycle occurs if, starting at any index in the array and following the jumps,every
  element in the array is visited exactly once before landing back on the starting index.

  Sample Input
   array = [2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]

  Sample Output
    true
