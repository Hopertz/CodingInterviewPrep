"""
  Max Path Sum In Binary Tree â™¡

  Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.
  A path is a collection of connected nodes in a tree, where no node is connected to more than two other
  nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path.
  Each BinaryTree node has an integer value , a left child node, and a right child node. Children
  nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null .

  Sample Input
     tree  =    1
              /   \
             2      3
            / \    / \
           4    5 6   7

  Sample Output
     18 //  5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 7
