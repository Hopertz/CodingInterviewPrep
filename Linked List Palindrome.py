"""
  Linked List Palindrome o â˜†
 Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and returns a boolean representing whether the linked
 list's nodes form a palindrome. Your function shouldn't make use of any auxiliary data structure.
 A palindrome is usually defined as a string that's written the same forward and backward. For a linked list's nodes to
 form a palindrome, their values must be the same when read from left to right and from right to left. Note that single-
 character strings are palindromes, which means that single-node linked lists form palindromes.
 Each LinkedList node has an integer value as well as a next node pointing to the next node in the list or to
 None 1 null if it's the tail of the list.
 You can assume that the input linked list will always have at least one node; in other words, the head will never be
 None / null.

  Sample Input
    head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1 -> p // the head node with value o

 Sample Output
    true
