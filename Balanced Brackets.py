"""
  Balanced Brackets

  Write a function that takes in a string made up of brackets( (, [, {, ) , ], and } )
  and other optional characters.The function should return a boolean representing whether
  the string is balanced with regards to brackets.

  A string is said to be balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a certain type as
  it has closing brackets of that type and if no bracket is unmatched.Note that an opening
  bracket can't match a corresponding closing bracket that comes before it and similarly, a
  closing bracket can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it.Also ,
  brackets can't match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it .Also, brackets
  can't overlap each other as in [(]).

  Sample Input
    string = '([])(){}(())()()'

  Sample Output
    true // it's balanced
