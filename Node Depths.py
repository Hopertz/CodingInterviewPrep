   Node's Depth

   The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's
   depths.
   Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.

   Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node.
   Children nodes can either be BinaryTree nodes themselves or None / null.

   Sample Input
      tree  =   1
              /   \
             2      3
            / \    /  \
           4    5 6   7
         / \
        8   9

   Sample Output
   16
   // The depth of the node with value 2 is 1.
   // The depth of the node with value 3 is 1
   // The depth of the node with value 4 is 2.
   // The depth of the node with value 5 is 2
   // The depth of the node with value 6 is 2.
   // The depth of the node with value 7 is 2
   // The depth of the node with value 8 is 3.
   // The depth of the node with value 9 is 3
   // Summing all of the depths yields 16
