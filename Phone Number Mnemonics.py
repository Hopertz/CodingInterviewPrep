    If you open the keypad of your mobile phone, it'll likely look like this:


     2 13 |
    | abc | def |
    | I | |
    14 15
    1 ghi |jkl | no |
    6
    I I I |
    17 | 8 | 9
    | pars tuvwxyz|

Almost every digit is associated with some letters in the alphabet; this allows certain phone numbers to spell out actual words. For example, the phone number 8464747328 can be written as
timisgreat ; similarly, the phone number 2686463 can be written as antoine or as ant6463 .
It's important to note that a phone number doesn't represent a single sequence of letters, but rather multiple combinations of letters. For instance, the digit 2 can represent three different letters (a, b,
and c).
Amnemonic is defined as a pattern of letters, ideas, or associations that assist in remembering something. Companies oftentimes use a mnemonic for their phone number to make it easier to remember.
Given a stringified phone number of any non-zero length, write a function that returns all mnemonics for this phone number, in any order.
