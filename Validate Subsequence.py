"""
   Validate Subsequence

   Given two non-empty arrays of integers,write a function that determines whether
   the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

   A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
   in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.For instance,
   the numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4] and so do the numbers
   [2. 4].Note that a single number in the array and the array itself are both valid
   subsequence of the array.

   Sample Input
     array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8,10]
     sequence = [1, 6 ,-1, 10]

   Sample Output
      True
